The AI engineer successfully built a Pokemon TCG deck tracker, progressing from initial requirements to a complex application. Key milestones include setting up a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend, implementing Google OAuth, and fixing critical CORS issues. The development then focused on a robust hand simulator, involving multiple iterations to accurately detect card types, integrate with the Pokemon TCG API, and later establish a local card database for performance. Subsequent work addressed UI responsiveness, data caching, and detailed card visual representations. The latest phase involved implementing comprehensive test statistics for mulligans and card ratios, and integrating these into the dashboard and deck detail views. The trajectory demonstrates iterative development, frequent testing, and direct response to user feedback, overcoming technical challenges like API instability and data consistency issues.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Pokemon TCG deck tracker application. Initial requirements included:
1.  **Deck Management:** Import decks from text (PTCGL format).
2.  **Match Tracking:** Keep track of win/losses (overall and against specific opponent decks), date of match, identify bad games (unplayable opening hands), and record if the player went first or second, with additional notes.
3.  **Authentication:** Google Login.
4.  **Styling:** Dark minimal design.
5.  **Card Preview & Consistency (Later additions):**
    *   Preview cards visually.
    *   Opening hand simulator with mulligan rules.
    *   Track mulligan count per deck.
    *   Correctly categorize Basic Pokemon (only those with Basic indicator), Evolved Pokemon, Trainers, and Energies.
    *   Visual color-coded borders for card types (Green: Pokemon, Blue: Trainers, Yellow: Energies).
    *   Smaller card display for small screens.
    *   Manual selection of basic Pokemon in hand simulator for mulligan decisions.
    *   Save button for mulligan test results.
    *   Mulligan button should always redraw hand.
    *   Draw opening hand subsequent clicks: redraw if basic clicked, do nothing if not.
6.  **Performance & Reliability (Later additions):**
    *   Faster deck import.
    *   Reliable card data fetching (initially from Pokemon TCG API, then transitioned to a local database).
7.  **Test Metrics (Latest additions):**
    *   Save mulligan percentage and card type ratios (Pokemon/Energy/Trainer) from test sessions.
    *   Display these test metrics on the deck's main page and dashboard.
    *   Display going second win/loss statistics on the deck's main page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating and displaying the newly implemented test statistics and going second win/loss statistics into the main application UI. This involves:

1.  **Displaying Test Statistics on Dashboard Deck Cards**: Modifying  to show the aggregated test results (e.g., mulligan percentage, card type ratios from simulations) for each deck listed.
2.  **Displaying Going Second W/L Statistics on Deck Detail Page**: Updating  to show the win/loss record specifically for games where the user went second.
3.  **Adjusting UI Grid Layout**: Modifying the grid structure in  to accommodate the additional stat cards or sections without disrupting the existing layout.

The last action performed was to modify the grid layout in  to accommodate the new stat card, and the next immediate step is to test these updated displays.
