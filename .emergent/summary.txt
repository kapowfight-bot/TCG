<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a Pokemon TCG deck tracker from initial requirements, progressively enhancing its functionality. Key features include full-stack implementation (FastAPI, React, MongoDB), Google OAuth, and a robust hand simulator. Significant development focused on improving card data reliability by transitioning from an external API to a local database, augmented by progressive population and scraping for images from LimitlessTCG when the primary API was unavailable. The UI was continuously refined to display detailed test statistics (mulligan, card ratios, basic Pokemon count), going second win/loss, collapsible sections, match history pagination, and a Meta Wizard feature for meta-game analysis. The work involved iterative problem-solving, including fixing CORS issues, data consistency (e.g., missing images in DB), deployment environment discrepancies, and refining user interaction with confirmation dialogs for test saves. The current focus is on debugging the Meta Wizard's web scraping.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Pokemon TCG deck tracker application with the following evolving requirements:
1.  **Deck Management:** Import decks from text (PTCGL format), with an option to edit existing decks and reset hand test statistics upon card changes.
2.  **Match Tracking:** Record win/losses (overall and against specific opponent decks), date, bad games (unplayable hands), player turn (first/second), and additional notes. Display going second win/loss statistics.
3.  **Authentication:** Google Login.
4.  **Styling:** Dark, minimal design.
5.  **Card Preview & Simulation:**
    *   Preview cards visually.
    *   Opening hand simulator with mulligan rules, tracking mulligan count.
    *   Correctly categorize (Basic, Evolved Pokemon, Trainers, Energies) and display with color-coded borders (Green: Pokemon, Blue: Trainers, Yellow: Energies).
    *   Smaller card display for small screens.
    *   Manual selection of basic Pokemon in hand simulator for mulligan decisions.
    *   Draw opening hand subsequent clicks should redraw if basic is clicked, do nothing if not, and show error if no basics.
    *   Save button for mulligan test results, with a prompt Are you sure there are no basic pokemon in the hand? if no basics are selected (YES: add 1 mulligan and save; NO: do nothing).
    *   Hover over cards in hand simulator to show a larger image preview.
    *   Add Basic Pokemon per hand statistic.
6.  **Performance & Reliability:**
    *   Faster, reliable card data fetching. Initially Pokemon TCG API, transitioned to a local database.
    *   Implement Refresh Card Data button in hand simulator to re-fetch and update deck's card data.
    *   Progressive local database population, creating basic card entries with images (from LimitlessTCG as fallback) if external APIs fail.
7.  **Test Metrics:**
    *   Save cumulative mulligan percentage and card type ratios (Pokemon/Energy/Trainer) from test sessions.
    *   Display these test metrics on the dashboard and deck detail pages.
8.  **UI Enhancements:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Replace deck list text block with an image of the main Pokemon from the deck's name, overlaying the overall win rate. Add Meta Wizard section to the right of the deck list, searching TrainerHill for 3 best/worst matchups with win ratios and a DO MAGIC refresh button.
    *   **Deck Detail:** Implement collapsible sections for Hand Simulator Test Results (start collapsed) and Match Statistics (start expanded). Implement pagination for Match History (show 5, Load More by 5, Show Less button).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the Meta Wizard feature into the Dashboard. This feature is intended to display the best and worst matchups for a user's selected deck by scraping data from .

The backend has a new endpoint  in , utilizing  and  for web scraping. The frontend, specifically , has been updated to include a dedicated Meta Wizard panel positioned to the right of the deck list, along with a DO MAGIC button to initiate the data fetching process.

The user reported that the feature is not correctly fetching and displaying matchup data. The AI engineer is currently in the process of debugging and refining the web scraping logic within the backend endpoint, having already analyzed the HTML structure of  to identify the correct parsing strategy for the matchup table.
